**DeepAID** is the first *Deep Learning Interpretation* method dedicated for *Anomaly Detection* models in *Security Domains*.  There are three superiorities of DeepAID Interpretations:
- **Unsupervised.** 
- **High Quality.** 
- **Versatile.** 
- TBA. 



# Implementation Notes

Current implementation of DeepAID only supports DL models built with Pytorch

TBA. 

# Examples

We provide several cases to show how to interpret your own anomaly detection models, including:

- [Tabular Data, Auto-Encoder, Synthetic Data](demos/tabular_synthesis/tabular_example_synthesis.ipynb)
- [Tabular Data, Kitsune (NDSS'18), Network Intrusion Detection](demos/tabular_kitsune/tabular_example_kitsune.ipynb)
- Time Series (Uni-), DeepLog (CCS'17), Log Anomaly Detection 
- Graph Data (Link Prediction, Embedding), GL-GV (RAID'20), APT Lateral Movement Detection
- TBA.
